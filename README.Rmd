# parlitools

A collection of useful tools for UK politics, including base maps and datasets.

## Installing

At present `parlitools` is only available on GitHub, although a CRAN release is being planned, to occur at least a fortnight ahead of the 2017 UK General Election.

To install the current version from GitHub, run:

```
devtools::install_github("evanodell/parlitools")
```

You will also need the development version of `mnis`:
```
devtools::install_github("evanodell/mnis")
```

## Data

`party_colours` - A tibble with the ID, name and hex code for the official colour of a variety of political parties, taken from Wikipedia. Includes all political parties with MPs and a number without MPs.

`bes_2015` - A tibble with the British Election Study 2015 Constituency Results Version 2.2. (source: http://www.britishelectionstudy.com/data-object/2015-bes-constituency-results-with-census-and-candidate-data/)

Tibbles with spending data from all candidates in the 2001, 2005, 2010 and 2015 General Elections. Named `spending_2001`, `spending_2005`, `spending_2010` and `spending_2015`.


## Data Retrieval

`current_mps` - Uses functions from `hansard` and `mnis` to create a tibble with data on all current MPs, their party affiliation and their constituency.

## Maps

`west_hex_map` - A hexagonal cartogram of Westminster parliamentary constituencies.
